- **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user authentication implemented using Lucia and Google OAuth integration.
- **Real-Time Interactions:** Integration with Stream Chat for live messaging capabilities.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS for a consistent experience across devices.
- **Database Integration:** Uses Prisma as an ORM for streamlined database interactions.
- **Robust API Endpoints:** APIs for posts, comments, user feeds, and search functionality.
- **State Management & Data Fetching:** Efficient data fetching and caching using React Query.

- **Next.js 15.x** – SSR & API Routes
- **TypeScript** – Strict type support
- **Prisma** – Database ORM & migrations
- **Lucia Auth** – Secure Authentication
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework
- **React Query** – Data fetching & caching
- **Stream Chat** – Real-time chat integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- A supported relational database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Pallab-Kashyap/sociofy.git
   cd sociofy
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   If you encounter peer dependency issues, use the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps
   ```
   Alternatively, if dependencies have been fixed and updated, a regular install might work:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following variables:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_url
   STREAM_API_KEY=your_stream_api_key
   STREAM_API_SECRET=your_stream_api_secret
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_nextauth_secret
   # Add any other environment variables required by your app
   ```

4. **Run Database Migrations**

   After configuring your database, run:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   ```

5. **Run the Development Server**

   Start the app:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the application in action.

## Environment Variables

Ensure all required environment variables are defined. Some key variables include:
- `DATABASE_URL` – Your database connection string.
- `STREAM_API_KEY` and `STREAM_API_SECRET` – Credentials for the Stream Chat API.
- Additional secrets needed for authentication and other integrations.

## Database Setup

This project uses Prisma as its ORM. After setting your `DATABASE_URL`, generate the Prisma client and run migrations:

## Deployment

This project is optimized for deployment on Vercel. For a production build, ensure you:
- Run `npm run build` locally.
- Address any peer dependency issues using `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` if necessary.
- Update any vulnerable packages using `npm audit fix` or `npm audit fix --force` after thorough local testing.
- Connect your repository to Vercel and set the appropriate environment variables in the Vercel dashboard.
